# regression projects 
I’m thrilled to present the three regression projects I completed as part of my internship at NeuronetiX with Instructor Eng. Mark Kostantine

1. Simple Linear Regression:
 - Objective: Analyzed the relationship between a single predictor variable (Years of Experience) and the target variable (Salary).

2. Multiple Linear Regression:
 - Objective: Examined how multiple predictor variables (Age and Experience)

3. Polynomial Regression:
 - Objective: Modeled the relationship using polynomial terms to capture nonlinear relationships between predictors and the target variable (Salary).

Key Differences:
- Simple Linear Regression: Single predictor, linear relationship.
- Multiple Linear Regression: Multiple predictors, linear relationship.
- Polynomial Regression: Single or multiple predictors, nonlinear relationships.

These projects provided a comprehensive introduction to different types of regression analysis and were instrumental in deepening my understanding of data modeling. I’m excited to apply these skills to more complex challenges in the future!
